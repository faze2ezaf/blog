My partner and I have been wanting to do some Christmas movie binge. These are what we are watching for the 2023 holiday season. 

### Single All the Way 

### The Noel Diary 

### Sleepless in Seattle 


### What's on our list to watch next
- Elf? 
- Home Alone 
- You've Got Mail (is my all time favorite Xmas movie)
- Love Actually (she always watches this on Xmas day)
